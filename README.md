BinaryNinja Keyhole
====================
This is a plugin for Binary Ninja Reversing Platform.

This plugin iterates over all identified functions in a given binary gathering information about:
 - number of instructions
 - number of basic blocks
 - number of function calls
 - number of times given function is being called

 Gathered informations are then presented in tabular form, sorted by number of instructions.

Such plugin might be useful in identifying where to start work during reversing.
